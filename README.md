- **Dynamic Leaderboard**: Automatically ranks donors based on their contribution amounts.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures valid input for donation amounts.
- **Testing Capabilities**: Generates fake donations for system demonstration.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Tkinter

## Team Contributions
- **Spencer**: Responsible for coding the donation tracker functionality, including the leaderboard and GUI.
- **You**: Managed the Kanban board, documented the project, and coordinated submission requirements.
- **Nox**: Supported project planning and provided valuable feedback during team meetings.

## How to Run
1. **System Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x installed on your system.
   - Tkinter (typically included with Python installations).

2. **Setup Instructions**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash

- **Expected Outcome**:
  - "Sophia" appears on the leaderboard with a $200 donation.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Non-numeric inputs in the donation field prompt an error message.

## Project Management
- **Communication**: Team members communicated via Discord for project updates and collaboration.
- **Kanban Board**: Tasks were organized and tracked using Monday.com.
- **Version Control**: Code and documentation were managed in a shared GitHub repository.

### Kanban Board Tasks
- **Sprint 1**:
  - Complete donation tracker system coding.
  - Test application functionality and address bugs.
  - Document project setup and features.
- **Backlog**:
  - Add data export functionality (CSV).
  - Plan for future payment gateway integration.

## Future Enhancements
- Export donation data to CSV for reporting.
- Integrate secure payment gateways for direct donations.
